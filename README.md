I began this project by creating the tic tac toe game board, then I worked on the board logic, and finally connected the page with a provided API.

User Stories:
as a non signed-in user, I can create an account and play the Game
as a signed-in user, I want to be able to change my password
as a signed-in user, I want to be able to sign out of my session
as a signed-in user playing the game, i want to be able to start the game over if there is a draw, or when one player wins, or at any point during the game, reset the board
as a playing-user, I want to make sure I CANNOT put multiple X's or O's on the same spot on the board
as a playing-user, I want to alternate between X and O without skipping turns
as a signed-in user, I want to be able to view my total games played (also need to show what each game looked like?)
as a signed-in playing-user, I want to be able to clear the board after sign out

Note: Future versions will hopefully more closely match the initial wire frames.  The layout and format also need to be addressed in the future; currently the page only reflects the most minimalistic of stylings.
